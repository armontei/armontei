## • What Coding Means To Me •

🐒 I've been interested in coding ever since I figured out how to extract layout styles from Neopets' profiles and use them in my own.

🕵️ I like to pay attention to the little things that often gets overlooked by others and error proof my code as much as I can. 

🤝 All websites should be accessible to users regardless of visual impairments, dexterity issues, hearing difficults, or device size. I hope to make that a reality with everything I create.
