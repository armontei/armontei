🐒 I'm fairly new to the world of web dev, but I've been interested in coding ever since I figured out how to extract layout styles from Neopets' profiles and use them in my own.

🤝 All websites should be accessible to users regardless of visual impairments, dexterity issues, hearing difficults, or device size. I hope to make that a reality with everything I create.
